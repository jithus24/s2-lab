WHERE job_title = 'Manager' AND department_name = 'Finance';
```

### 25. **Check whether it is possible to update the phone number of employee whose first name is ‘Smith’ by using the above-created view.**

Updating is not possible using a view if the view contains multiple tables or aggregated data. However, if your view is directly showing data from a single table and you have proper privileges, you can update it. In this case, since the view combines multiple tables, an update might not be allowed.

To test if an update is possible, you can attempt to run:

```sql
UPDATE employee_details_in_delhi
SET phone_number = '1234567890'
WHERE first_name = 'Smith';
```

### 26. **Display the details of employee who have no dependents.**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.employee_id
FROM employees e

WHERE d.dependent_id IS NULL;
```

### 27. **Display the details of employee who manager id is 101 or 201. (Use Union Clause)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id = 101
UNION
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id = 201;
```

### 28. **Display the details of employees who have at least one dependent.**

```sql
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.employee_id
FROM employees e
JOIN dependents d ON e.employee_id = d.employee_id;
```
